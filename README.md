# Food4All

Food4All NYC is an application that can act as a resourse for lower inclome families of NYC to access healthier food options with SNAP EBT benefits. It is a desktop app built with QT Framework and C++11.

The intention of this app is to make lower income families of NYC aware of the various resources that are out there to access healthier food options to lead a healthier lifestyle, and avoid long-term and harmful diseases that come with consuming unhealthy junk food.

This app is developed from scratch by Mir Afra Humaira, under the supervision of Dr. Azhar as an Honor's Project for the course CSC211H Advanced Programming Techniques. 


# Inspiration for Food4All
In an expensive city like New York, food security is a major issue for lower income residents. Unhealthy food options are promoted more, and are cheaper than healthier food options like fruits and vegetables. Food4All is an app that acts as resource to lower income New Yorkers to find affordable food options by displaying locations of Farmers' Markets that accept SNAP EBT. Information on prevalent diseases caused by consuming unhealthy food are also provided, and how they can be prevented/controlled by healthy eating.

# Project Description

This app contains information about the nutritional values of consuming fruits and vegetables and how they can help with the dangerous health issues like Diabetes, Obesity, Hypertension. Locations and names of Farmers' markets that accept SNAP EBT as payments are also provided. The locations are visualized from smallest to largest Community District numbers.

If one is unaware of their community district number, a link to Beta NYC's boundaries map is provided, from where the user can look up any address within NYC and find the community district for it.
